# PokeGan
A Deep Convolutional GAN that is capable of generating new Pok√©mon!

## Data 

I've written a simple webscraping script that obtains all pokemon images from [here](pokemondb.net)
All images are in 

'''
pokemon_imgs
'''

## Installation and Prerequisites

All you need is Keras.

'''
pip install keras
'''

## Running the script

'''
$ python dcgan.py
'''

## Results

All results -i.e generated pokemon - are stored in the **images** folder.
